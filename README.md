# Flutter Autocomplete Textfield

An autocomplete textfield for flutter

## pull requests

Feel free to submit pull requests for desired changes / features / bug fixes... It makes the maintenance of this code much easier as I no longer use Flutter frequently.

## Breaking Changes

TextField is set by default to call onSubmitted on a suggestion tap and also to clear the TextField on submit.

These can both be disabled with submitOnSuggestionTap and clearOnSubmit respectively.

## Usage

AutoCompleteTextField supports any data type suggestions

   ```
   new AutoCompleteTextField<YOURDATATYPE>()
   ```

The suggestions parameter must have data that matches <YOURDATATYPE>

A global key of type GlobalKey<AutoCompleteTextFieldState<T>> is required so that the clear() method can be called to clear AutoCompleteTextField.

## Strings and itemFilter

Filtering is case sensitive so when using strings a common implementation of itemFilter is .

   ```
   itemFilter: (item, query) {
  return item.toLowerCase().startsWith(query.toLowerCase());
}
   ```
